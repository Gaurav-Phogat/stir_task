To complete this task I have used multiple things including proxymesh,selenium and mongodb.

If anyone wants to use my script feel free to do so.

If you wish to use it effetively you will need to make .env file and add these

TWITTER_USERNAME= ******
TWITTER_PASSWORD= ****** 
PROXYMESH_USER= ******
PROXYMESH_PASSWORD= *****

you will need a twitter/x.com account and a proxymesh Account.

After you have added these and run the script you should see the below page 

![Starting Page](/start.png) 

After clicking the selenium proccess should start and it will login into x.com and when it finishes logging in and retrieving data it will auto close the tab so do not click anything else

after the x.com tab closes your html page should display the below things 

![Final Page](/final.png)

and when you go back to check on the mongodb database in mongodb compass you should see something like shown below
